day_003
Yesterday wasn't very fruitful. I wasn't able to accomplish what i set out to do.
Today i looked into the input function a little more and figured out what i was doing wrong.

I took each question and placed it into its own function so that i can check whether or not the input
was of the correct type before going to the next question.

I was able to make it work only if the inputs were correct, otherwise i am stuck with a while loop that keeps jumping
to the else statement and ignoring everything else.

I need to do some more reading and figure out what i'm' doing wrong.
